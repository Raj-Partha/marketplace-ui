        Decentralisation
      </div>
      <div>
        DLT provides all members of a given network with a single, holistic view that is not controlled or managed by any single
        given entity. This disintermediates the ‘middle-man’ and creates a level playing field upon which all economic participants
        are afforded the opportunity to transact on an equal footing.

        Immutability
      </div>
      <div>
        Distributed ledgers achieve immutability because all updates are iterative, i.e. they are appended to the ledger, as opposed
        to replacing previous states. In addition to this, iterations cannot be made unless the network defined consensus
        mechanism is satisfied.

        Smart Contracts
      </div>
      <div>
        also known as a cryptocontract , is a computer program that directly controls the transfer of digital currencies or assets
        between parties under certain conditions. A smart contract not only defines the rules and penalties related to an
        agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but it can also automatically enforce those obligations.
